Turns out, Lionel Messi coming to town brings big business along with it.

Messi, one of the world’s biggest stars, is coming to Sandy when his Inter Miami squad plays Real Salt Lake on April 22.

And the line to get tickets starts way back there.

Real Salt Lake has already received more than 40,000 requests for single-game tickets for Messi’s Utah debut, a team spokesperson said.

The club launched a “priority waitlist” for fans last week and has received over 30,000 sign-ups in the first week.

The club also sold 1,000 additional full-season tickets once Messi appeared on the home schedule.

The current RSL attendance record is 21,810 against LAFC in 2022. Messi’s first game in Utah is likely to top that.

For fans willing to spend more to jump the line, RSL is selling multi-game packages that include the Inter Miami match. There are currently three, four-game packages that include that game. RSL has sold 2,000 of those packages, the spokesperson said.

Single-game tickets go on sale sometime in January.

“Based on our existing commitments to present, past and interested season-ticket holders, as well as a handful of group ticketing commitments, only a limited number of single-game tickets could be available once we release the entire 17-game regular season slate to the general public,” RSL said in a statement.

Messi’s club won its first Major League Soccer Cup this year.
